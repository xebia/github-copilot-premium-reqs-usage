# GitHub Copilot Premium Requests Usage Analyzer

A single-page application that visualizes GitHub Copilot premium request usage data from CSV exports. This tool helps you understand your team's Copilot usage patterns.

## Quick Start

Need to analyze the premium requests CSV? 
I created a SPA with Spark and Coding Agent to display an overview of the Premium Requests CSV that you can currently download (no API yet ðŸ˜“), so share it where needed! 
 
Hosted on GitHub Pages: [GitHub Copilot Premium Requests Usage Analyzer](https://xebia.github.io/github-copilot-premium-reqs-usage/)

Upload the CSV from the enterprise export (Billing and Licenses â†’ Usage â†’ Export dropdown right top)
 
Result:
