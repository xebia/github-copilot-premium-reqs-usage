   - What: Visualize daily request data with color-coded status indicators showing compliant vs exceeding requests
   - Why: Makes usage patterns and quota status immediately apparent
   - Success: Clearly shows trends over time and distinguishes between quota-compliant and exceeding requests

3. **Data Processing**
   - What: Transform raw CSV data into aggregated daily metrics by model, correctly handling decimal request values
   - Why: Converts raw timestamp data into meaningful daily summaries, ensuring accurate representation of fractional requests
   - Success: Correctly groups and counts requests by day, model, and quota status, properly parsing and displaying decimal values

4. **Model Usage Statistics**
   - What: Display detailed model usage statistics in tabular format
   - Why: Provides granular insights into which models are being used and their quota status
   - Success: Clear presentation of model-specific usage data in an easily scannable table format
   
5. **Bar Chart Visualization**
   - What: Visualize model usage per day with multi-colored bar chart
   - Why: Offers an alternative visualization that highlights model distribution over time
   - Success: Clearly distinguishes between different models and shows their relative usage per day

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
- **Emotional Response**: Confidence, clarity, and professionalism
- **Design Personality**: Clean, analytical, and technical with a modern GitHub-inspired aesthetic
- **Visual Metaphors**: Data flow, resource monitoring
- **Simplicity Spectrum**: Minimal interface with focus on the visualization

### Color Strategy
- **Color Scheme Type**: Custom palette with GitHub-inspired colors
- **Primary Color**: Xebia-purple (oklch(0.6 0.2 280)) - represents the professional identity
- **Secondary Colors**: Neutral grays for UI elements
- **Accent Color**: Green for compliant requests, Red for quota-exceeding requests
- **Color Psychology**: Purple conveys creativity and innovation
- **Color Accessibility**: High contrast between text and backgrounds, distinct colors for data visualization
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**:
  - Background (oklch(0.98 0.01 240)) / Foreground (oklch(0.25 0.01 240))
  - Card (oklch(1 0 0)) / Card-foreground (oklch(0.25 0.01 240))
  - Primary (oklch(0.55 0.18 250)) / Primary-foreground (oklch(1 0 0))
  - Secondary (oklch(0.9 0.03 240)) / Secondary-foreground (oklch(0.3 0.01 240))
  - Accent (oklch(0.65 0.15 145)) / Accent-foreground (oklch(0.2 0.01 240))
  - Destructive (oklch(0.65 0.15 30)) / Destructive-foreground (oklch(1 0 0))

### Typography System
- **Font Pairing Strategy**: Single sans-serif font family for consistency with weight variations for hierarchy
- **Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear heading/body distinction with size and weight
- **Font Personality**: Professional, clean, highly readable
- **Readability Focus**: Generous line height, optimal line length for instructions
- **Typography Consistency**: Consistent font sizing using relative units
- **Which fonts**: Inter - a clean, modern sans-serif optimized for screen readability
- **Legibility Check**: High legibility at all sizes, works well for both data labels and body text

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
- **Attention Direction**: Upload area prominent initially, visualization takes focus after data is loaded
- **White Space Philosophy**: Generous spacing to create focus on the visualization
- **Grid System**: Simple single-column layout on mobile, extending to a more spacious layout on larger screens
- **Responsive Approach**: Chart container adapts to available width, UI controls stack on smaller screens
- **Content Density**: Focused presentation with minimal UI elements competing with the data visualization

### Animations
- **Purposeful Meaning**: Subtle transitions when loading data and rendering chart
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Chart animation shows data appearing sequentially to help comprehension
- **Contextual Appropriateness**: Minimal animations focused on data state changes

### UI Elements & Component Selection
- **Component Usage**: Card with drag-and-drop support for the upload area, Button for triggering upload, Toast for notifications
- **Component Customization**: Rounded corners and subtle shadows for cards, visual feedback for drag states
- **Component States**: Clear hover/focus states for interactive elements, distinctive styling for drag-over states
- **Icon Selection**: Upload icon, chart icon, and information icon where appropriate
- **Component Hierarchy**: Upload component as primary action initially, chart as main focus after data load
- **Spacing System**: Consistent spacing using Tailwind's spacing scale
- **Mobile Adaptation**: Stacked layout on mobile with full-width components

### Visual Consistency Framework
- **Design System Approach**: Component-based using shadcn components
- **Style Guide Elements**: Typography scale, color tokens, spacing rhythm
- **Visual Rhythm**: Consistent padding and spacing throughout the interface
- **Brand Alignment**: GitHub-inspired aesthetic with professional data visualization

### Accessibility & Readability
- **Contrast Goal**: WCAG AA compliance for all text and interactive elements
- **Chart Accessibility**: Multiple visual cues beyond color (patterns or labels) to distinguish data series

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios
- **Potential Obstacles**: Malformed CSV files, very large datasets, fractional request values
- **Edge Case Handling**: Validation messaging for incorrect file formats, graceful handling of parsing errors, proper display of decimal values
- **Technical Constraints**: Browser-based CSV parsing limitations

## Implementation Considerations
- **Scalability Needs**: Potential for additional chart types or filtering options in the future
- **Testing Focus**: Validate with various CSV formats and sizes
- **Critical Questions**: How to optimize performance for large datasets?
- **Deployment Strategy**: Configured for GitHub Pages deployment to enable simple sharing and access without requiring server infrastructure

## Reflection
- This approach uniquely focuses on simplicity and clarity for a technical audience needing quick insights.
- We assume users have access to correctly formatted GitHub Copilot usage exports.
- The exceptional aspect will be the intuitive visualization that immediately communicates patterns without requiring manual data manipulation.
